ベッドの?心地がよく、ゆっくりくつろげました。金井山城のミニトレッキングをしてきたので、なおさらだったです。?心?の?泉は１回付だったので、宿泊者はいつでも無料にしてくれるともっと良かった。でも、１回でもくつろげました。シャンプ?リンスを持っていくことを忘れずに。/Foreign,0.359873672,

ダブルの部屋を１人で利用しましたが、部屋は綺麗で快適で、問題は全く感じませんでした。?業員もある程度日本語ができ、少なくとも英語は通じるので問題ありませんでした。何よりも良かったのは、附設のス?パ??湯（?心?）で?泉が?日無料で?しめることで、?日の疲れをしっかり取ることができ、魅力できでした。市街中心部から少し離れてはいますが、むしろ周?は地元感に?れやすく、魅力的に感じました。また宿泊したいと思えるホテルでした。/Foreign,0.359873672,

結果的には、ホテルのフロント係に、ホテル予約サイトに連絡をしてなぜ予約が確保できていなかったのか原因を問い合わせていることを?えたところ、スカイパ?クホテルの予約係のほうで最初はきちんとバスタブ付のダブルル?ムで予約が取れていたのだけれど、先にチェックインした他の宿泊客がバスタブつきの部屋を希望したためそちらに部屋をまわしたことを?明されました。私は予約をする際に到着が夜?くなるレイト?チェックインを予め?えていたので、到着前に勝手に部屋を?えるのは明らかにホテル側のミスです。またフロント係にバスタブのある他タイプの部屋はないのか再度に尋ねたところ、サブマネ?ジャ?らしい方が代わって電話で??をされ、トリプルル?ムなら空いているとのことで、その日はその部屋に?更してもらえたのですが、こちらが?っていたらそのままバスタブのないシャワ?のみの部屋に/Foreign,-0.875453637,
